				I am a kind, quirky, hard-working perfectionist who is passionate about giving people the opportunity
				to express themselves and showcase thier work or business via the World Wide Web using my talent 
				and skill as a Web Developer.
				<br><br>
				Over the course of my career in IT, I've learned that my particular area of expertise lies in web design and development.
				Having worked in multiple fast-paced, deadline-driven environments, I have a proven track record of consistently delivering complex
				projects on time and to budget. I've played a key role in the development of key features for client and internal websites, including
				WordPress migrations, form/document integrations, and user experience improvements. In every web design project I've managed, I've
				consistently exceeded performance metrics when it comes to business requirements and client expectations. Furthermore, I possess
				exceptional time management, critical thinking, and organizational skills that enable me to excel in demanding work conditions.
